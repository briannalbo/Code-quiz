## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.
## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score.
## Challenge Work Done
This challenge involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive quiz.
I created a basic html and css framework then added JavaScript to make the webpage
interactive. Users are provided with quiz instructions, a start button to initiate
the quiz. After answering each question the user is notified whether they were 
correct or incorrect. After all of the quiz questions have been answered, a final
score is displayed and the user is prompted to enter their initials. The users
score and initials are saved in local storage. I created a second index.html file
to display the users scores. They are then given the choice to retry the quiz.
Users also have the option to clear the scoreboard. This quiz was created using a 
series of javaScript functions triggered by how the user interacts with the page.
For more information on how the quiz functions please refer to the notes 
within the code files.
